Having a community of over 3000 members on the North America IOSoccer Discord is an achievement that is noteworthy. But, occasionally with each passing event or game that goes on, there is a notable feeling of "emptiness" in the discord. Nothing to record stats, review performances, and tier people's skill level. So here we are: The NA Community Bot. 

A bot that creates a rating system from spreadsheets that output people's ratings and outputs them in a colored-tier system based on FIFA's card system. Not only that, a viewing of the top 10 best, each rating by position, as well as a system to view other's ratings individually. Not just that, but a few community moderating commands to keep the community secure. 

## Usage

The way this bot works is as follows:

You basically have a few slash commands that you input in any given channel. However, you must be a registered player. To be registered, you must have played at least 10 matches with us in a given month. Some kind of activity to show you are there. Once that has been satisfied, we take the stats of the performances in those matches and compile a rating that reflects that. This rating will be linked to your discord ID and is now apart of our database. With each passing month, a new ratings list will come out.

Here's the list of commands:

| Command                       | Action                                                                                                     |
